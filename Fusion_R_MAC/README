Below is the readme from Tolias, we simply place here for others to configure the code.

What is it?
(Below is from the original version of R-MAC)
===========

This is a Matlab/MEX package that we provide to implement the methods
of our ICLR 2016 paper (paper homepage: http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05879).
This code implements 
a) MAC and R-MAC image representation
b) Image retrieval based on MAC and R-MAC
c) Localization re-ranking (AML) and query expansion (QE)
d) Evaluation on Oxford5k and Paris6k test datasets

Prerequisites
=============

The prerequisites are:
- a working and recent version of Yael library (version >= v438).
  The Yael library can be obtained from the website https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=2151

- MatConvNet MATLAB toolbox 1.0-beta15
  http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/download/matconvnet-1.0-beta15.tar.gz

- Images of Oxford5k and Paris6k datasets: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/

- Pre-trained CNN models. In our paper we have used AlexNet and VGG16. The mat files containing the models will be downloaded during execution of the code. The current files on matconvnet website are slightly different from the ones we used (older versions downloaded from matconvnet website).

Execution
=============

1) Run the following script
>> test
%mAP, after re-ranking and QE = 0.7733
